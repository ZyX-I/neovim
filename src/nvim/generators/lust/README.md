Lua string templates, a copy of https://github.com/weshoke/Lust. Used for its 
most compact syntax and such interesting feature as `@map{…, _separator = …}`.

Copied because engine is not being maintained currently (last commit at 
05.08.2017 was at 25.06.2015) and README does not mention luarocks, as well as 
no rockspec is present.
